# To-Do List App with JavaScript OOP

A simple To-Do List application built using JavaScript with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This app demonstrates the use of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism while managing tasks. It also uses `localStorage` to persist tasks even after a page refresh.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks by entering a title.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Toggle the completion status of each task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses `localStorage` to store tasks, ensuring that tasks are saved even after the page is refreshed.
- **OOP Concepts**: Includes the use of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to manage tasks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: OOP principles like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Basic styles for the To-Do list.
- **LocalStorage**: To save tasks on the user's browser.

## 🔧 Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list-app.git
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   
   ```bash
   cd to-do-list-app

3. Open index.html in your browser:

- ** You can simply double-click the index.html file, or

- ** Use a live server extension if you are using VS Code.

3. Start adding tasks:

- ** Enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task".

- ** Tasks will be displayed in the list below.

- ** Click "Mark as Complete" to toggle a task's status.

- ** Click "Delete" to remove a task.

🧠 OOP Concepts Explained

- Abstraction: The complexities of managing tasks (adding, removing, and toggling) are hidden behind simple methods.

- Encapsulation: Task data like id, title, and completed status are managed using private fields and methods.

- Inheritance: The ImportantTask class extends the Task class, allowing specialized tasks with a priority feature.

- Polymorphism: Overridden methods in ImportantTask provide customized behaviors, such as handling the priority field differently.

📦 Local Storage

The tasks are stored in localStorage, making the app data persistent. Even if you refresh or close the browser, the tasks will remain saved.
